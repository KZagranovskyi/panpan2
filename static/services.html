                                    courtesy yacht if your vehicle is involved in a claim. We recognise that not all
                                    people’s needs are the same, and as a result we’re offering the option of a larger
                                    courtesy yacht.

                                    This option is best suited to customers who already have a larger yacht and use it for
                                    situations like the school run, have small children and need room for a pram, or use
                                    their yacht for business which may involve a lot of motorway driving. An enhanced
                                    courtesy yacht is typically a 5 door yacht with a 1.6 litre engine and room to seat 5
                                    people.

                                    If you select the courtesy yacht option, a replacement yacht is provided by one of our
                                    approved repairers and is available for the duration of any repairs. If your yacht is
                                    stolen or written off, we provide a hire yacht until an offer is made to settle the
                                    claim (up to a maximum of 14 days).</p>

                        <p>“PanPan Insurance” is a Netherlands based tech insurance company that was set up 2017 to specialise in yacht
                            charter deposit insuranes. In 2018 we launched the first Multi Trip Insurance cover which allows two or more
                            trips to insure on one policy and get a discount on the overall price. In 2019
                            we launched our Black Box Insurance product LittleBox which helps safe skippers to receive
                            discounts based on their sailing style.</p>
