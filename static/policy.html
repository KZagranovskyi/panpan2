                                        Remember, you can find controls to manage your information and protect your privacy and

                                        account.
                                        We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using

                                        and
                                        provide (including improving and personalizing) the services we offer, to send
                                        communications,
                                        including promotional communications, and to display advertising. In carrying out these
                                        purposes, we combine data we collect through the various web site services you use to
                                        give

                            <p>“PanPan Insurance” is a Netherlands based tech insurance company that was set up 2017 to specialise in yacht
                                charter deposit insuranes. In 2018 we launched the first Multi Trip Insurance cover which allows two or more
                                trips to insure on one policy and get a discount on the overall price. In 2019
                                we launched our Black Box Insurance product LittleBox which helps safe skippers to receive
                                discounts based on their sailing style.</p>
